# ReadingCompanion
Chrome extension to help you get through long articles.
You can track your paragraph reading progress, annotate each paragraph, and export your annotations.

This was mainly coded by Claude, since I don't have much front-end experience.

To run:
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Turn on Developer mode on the right
- Go to "Load unpacked" and select the the ReadingCompanion directory
